"To do a PhD, you need to be at the top of your class.",No,"While good grades are a sign that you are probably working hard and have lots of capabilities within your field, I would not focus on them as a thing in itself. Exploring what interested you and developing that further was much more important to me.",No,"It's of course important to think about your overall grade average - sadly, it sometimes still plays a role when you're looking for funding. But it is definitely not necessary to be the top student in each of your classes!",No,"You need to be patient, determined and able to deal with stress. You need to believe in yourself and know your strenghts. You don't need to be top of your class but you should be good at studying and most of all you should enjoy it.",Yes,"Talent in your field certainly helps. Otherwise, you risk falling behind in an increasingly competitive academic environment.",No,"Good grades don't nesseccarily translate into being a good researcher. Being the top of your class is more like winning a sprint race, while doing a PhD is more like a marathon: knowing how to pace myself is much more important now than it was when I was a student.",No,Getting good grades is definitely not a requirement for doing a PhD. What's most important is that you enjoy doing research and that you are dedicated and determined!,No,"I believe there are many different personal characteristics that can lead to a successful PhD trajectory. Being at the top of your class can certainly help, but in my view it is neither the only requirement nor the only path to success."
"To do a PhD, you need to be highly independent.",Yes,"Some supervisors will be more involved with the day-to-day work than others. It helps a lot to be self-directed and be able to work indepently towards longterm goals. In the cooperation with your supervisors and possibly other team members, it is valuable to develop a clear image of what you yourself consider worthwhile and insightful research.",Yes,"Working on your project independently is a crucial part of your PhD journey. However, sometimes it's even more important to know how to work in a team with your colleagues and supervisors.",Yes,Nobody is going to tell you exactly what to do and exactly when you need to do it. You basically have to be a project manager of a 4-year fulltime project. ,Yes,"Having a demanding supervisor can actually strengthen your resilience. By the time you graduate, you’ll be a much more competitive researcher.",Yes,"All PhDs ask for a certain degree of independence (as do arguably most jobs at university level education). That being said, because of the structure of the project I am in, my PhD also involves a lot of teamwork and making sure that our plannings are fine-tuned to each other. ",Yes,"While a good supervisor can support you where it's needed, a lot of the PhD trajectory will be led by you, so it's important that you feel able to work and make important decisions independently.",Yes,I think a certain level of independence is a major advantage and is also something that supervisors expect from their PhD candidates.
"Doing a PhD is financially worth it.",Yes,"I quit a permanent role and took a paycut to do my PhD so I considered this before I applied. If you want to pursue a career in academia, it can be a barrier of entry to do a PhD. In the Netherlands, the pay gets a lot better after the first year.",Yes,"It largely depends on the place you choose to do it in! Countries like the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark do offer paid positions for PhD researchers. At least in my experience, the pay itself is quite competitive and allows me to live without fincancial restrictions.",No,"Depends on your field, in my case, it is probably not the best choice I could have made. If I wanted to get rich I should have gone into industry as soon as I could.",No,"It depends on your field. In social sciences and humanities, a PhD may not make you wealthy financially, but it can certainly enrich you intellectually.",No,"Financially, I think it is not the greatest decision, but nor was studying archaeology. Some of my friends from the same bachelor's make much more than me and have a clearer career path ahead. But, who knows what the future brings? ",Yes,"In many ways, a PhD can be a good career move, especially in the humanities were there can be less access to high-paying industry jobs. That being said, you should never pursue academia with the intent of getting rich, as there are certainly less demanding fields that pay the same",Yes,"I think a PhD can be financially beneficial later in your career, even though it is not particularly lucrative while you are doing it."
"Doing a PhD is lonely.",No,"Different research fields and projects have differing degrees of cooperation. I work on my own a lot, reading, writing and going into archives, but I do not feel lonely. My PhD is part of a bigger project and there's a real team spirit.",Yes,"It can be sometimes, but it will largely depend on the setup of your project (whether you belong to a big research team or do the project more independently). I sometimes long for my research team to be ten times as big :)",No,"I have a dual position between two research groups and I love seeing both of them every week. I see colleagues of both offices regularly outside of work and consider some of them (close) friends. It can be a lonely experience if you feel nobody is as deep into your subject as you are, but this is where a good relationship with your supervisor should come in.",Yes,"Outside academia, very few people are genuinely interested in the details of your research.",No,"It helps that I share a space with my supervisor and the post-doc in my project, but even besides that, I am generally surrounded by colleagues from the department. Plus, there are plenty of opportunities to meet people through conferences and courses!  ",No,"I think this is highly dependent on the circumstances of your PhD, and on the personal choices you make. I'm part of a close-knit project team, and meet many other early career researchers through NICA, ASCA, and other PhD and academic organizations.",No,"For me, a PhD is not lonely at all. I work with many interesting people and regularly meet new people through conferences, workshops, and collaborations."
"Doing a PhD is not a 'real' job, because you are a student.",No,"Doing a PhD is a very specific kind of job, perhaps you can consider it as an 'academic traineeship'. In the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany it is treated as paid employment while in the United Kingdom and the United States paid PhD-positions are still considered funded studies. ",No,"You are paid, seen as an employee of the university and are actively creating new knowledge through your work. ",No,You get paid so it is a job.,No,"If you approach a PhD with a student mindset, instead of adopting a researcher’s attitude, you’re likely to struggle.",No,"For me, doing a PhD is a job, not a hobby. No working on the weekends! ",No,"This really differs by country, but in the Netherlands you get paid, you get vacation days, you have a contract, and you are treated as an employee by the university. ",Yes,"Yes, you are a student, but I see that as an advantage. A PhD is also a learning process: being open to feedback and giving yourself time to grow is essential. Things will not be perfect at the beginning, and that is okay."
"Doing a PhD is more than a 'real' job, because it requires more emotional and time investment.",Yes,"The time investment of a PhD should not need to exceed that of other fulltime jobs. I do think that for me, it is different in terms of the emotional and intellectual investment than my previous job. It feels more personal and thinking about my work can carry into the evenings or weekend.",Yes,"Many PhD researchers have a strong affinity with their project and care deeply about the questions they seek to ask in their work. To me personally, this type of work has a lot more meaning than certain industry/profit-focused positions. When it comes to time investment, it is important to learn how to draw boundaries and plan your time early on, as you might be expected to work a lot more than a full-time position.",No,"It does require more investment than some jobs. However, there are jobs that require even more investment and some people in corporate companies are way more dedicated to their jobs than I will ever be. A PhD is just a job and you'll enjoy it most if you consider it just a job.",Yes,"Unlike a typical job, a PhD doesn’t end at 5 p.m. It stays with you until you graduate or quit.",No,"Any job is as emotional and time-intensive as you let it get. With a PhD, it is definitely easier to put in more emotion or time, because there is no external force (a boss, a manager etc.) forcing you to be pragmatic. However, I don't think this always makes the research better, and personally I try to keep a bit of emotional distance.",Yes,"A PhD, and academia in general, often asks more of you than what is possible within the working hours that you are paid for. It is important to put in effort to protect your free time, but it is also undeniable that it's the kind of job that requires your emotional and mental investment more than many other jobs.",Yes,"Even if you stick to regular working hours, your research stays with you mentally. Compared to a regular job, it requires a deeper emotional and intellectual investment."
"To be successful in your PhD, you need a good relationship with your supervisor.",Yes,"Your supervisor is there to help you flourish and if you are working well together, it makes a big difference. It is not the case you have to know your supervisor personally before starting the PhD but knowing their work and research profile should definitely be a part of your orientation.",Yes,"In my opinion, a good team of supervisors is one of the absolute most important things in your PhD journey!",Yes,I picked my PhD not based on subject but based on supervisor and I am thankful for that every day. When you are applying to PhD positions you should always ask other PhDs how their experience with the supervisor is as part of the decision process.,Yes,"Feedback from your supervisor can save you significant time and effort, helping you stay on track.",Yes,"You don't need to be friends with your supervisor, but being able to communicate well with each other, really, really helps. A competent supervisor can pull you back if you are prone to tunnel-vision, or encourage you when you are feeling ensure. ",Yes,"The relationship with your supervisor is very central to your PhD trajectory. While there are methods of mediation if your relationship turns sour (i.e. going to the PhD dean), this can be mentally and emotionally taxing.",Yes,"You are highly dependent on your supervisor. A professional and respectful relationship, on both sides, is essential. In my opinion, it is wise to research potential supervisors before accepting a PhD position."
